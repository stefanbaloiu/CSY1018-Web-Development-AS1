                <h3>1st Entry</h3>
                <p>It's been quite hectic with starting work on the assignment and it could very well be because I started it late but it's been going well every time I worked on it(sometimes more than other times).</p>
                <p>What's been causing me problems however was mostly the fact that I did not have a set design in mind to be honest, did not know exactly what I want to put in it etc.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>2nd Entry</h3>
                <p>When I first started working on the project, namely on the 5th of April, I thought I'd have all the time in the world to finish it quickly. Of course I was wrong because real life intervened and made this, the site, seem like it was never going to get finished.</p>
                <p>At first it was my girlfriend moving, then it was another assignment/TCA and then it was some of my relatives flying over in the UK to visit and spend a weekend together in London. I lost track of time and all of these happened really quickly so here I am, in this shitty hotel in London(don't even get me started on that part) at 6:40PM trying to finish this up quickly.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>3rd Entry</h3>
                <p>For sure all of this could have been avoided if I wasn't so laid-back to the point it starts affecting my work performance. Would be a lie if I said this is the first time it has happened but oh well, you reap what you sow.</p>
                <p>Slowly but surely my website was coming apart, getting "built" into what it is now. I'm sure you'll notice in the commits and or branches that one file that has not yet been touched LOL... Hope you like what I've done though.</p>
